# PokÃ©dex ðŸ”´âš¡

## ðŸ“– About

This is a PokÃ©dex developed using React and TypeScript, using data from the PokÃ©API. The UI framework TailwindCSS was chosen for styling. The React Query library was used for local API data caching and asynchronous state management using the stale-while-revalidate approach. For testing, Jest was used together with React Testing Library. ESLint and Prettier were used for code standardization.
